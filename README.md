# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to look at how the data differs by city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 

## Results
The following is a summary table of statistics:

![Summary Table](https://github.com/remenars/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Summary_Table.png)

* The more urban a city is, the more rides occur
* There are more drivers in urban cities
* The average fare per ride is higher in Rural Cities
* The average fare per driver is higher in Rural Cities
* The total fares are higher in Urban cities

Looking at the weekly totals for the period of 1/1/2019 - 4/28/2019, we see that the data is stacked neatly on top of eachhother with Urban cities earning the most and Rural cities the least:

## Summary
I would recommend:
* Increasing the number of drivers in Surburban cities to increase the total amount of fares
* Increasing the cost of fares in Urban cities to bring in more total fare
* Advertising in Rural cities to bring in more rides
